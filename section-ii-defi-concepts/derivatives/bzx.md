# bZx

## Summary

bZx defines a protocol for decentralized margin trading. It employs a hybrid order model, where third-party relayers each maintain their own order book while orders are settled on-chain.

To provide fair pricing of assets, bZx uses oracle providers to send price data to the network. Providers set a fee for their services and users select oracles of their choice when they make orders. bZx plans to introduce an 'Oracle Registry', which will aggregate oracles selected via a decentralized governance process.
