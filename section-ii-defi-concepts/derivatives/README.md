# Derivatives

As is the case in the traditional financial sector, a derivative is a financial product whose value is related to the performance of something else like an asset, index, or interest rate.

Stablecoins can be considered derivatives but not all derivatives can be considered stablecoins. 

Cryptocurrency-based derivatives often use decentralized exchanges and/or prediction markets to facilitate trading.
