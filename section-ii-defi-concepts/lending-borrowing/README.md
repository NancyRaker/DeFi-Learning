# Lending/Borrowing

Decentralized lending is a field of application that involves the creation of automated money markets. 

An automated money market enables lenders to deposit cryptocurrency and gain interest while borrowers get access to liquidity in exchange for paying an interest rate using an entirely automated platform.

In the world of traditional finance, money markets include short-term investments in debt like money market funds, certificates of deposit \(CDs\), municipal notes, and treasury bills \(also known as government bonds\).
