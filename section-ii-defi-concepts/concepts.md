## Decentralization

In a general sense, decentralization is a process by which power is distributed away from an intermediary authority. 

In the context of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, it means developing open source software that serves either the same or a similar function to existing financial products and services.

## Finance

What is Finance, Anyway?

Finance encompasses the theory and practice of raising and managing funds in a personal, organizational, or public context. 

* Personal finance explores how individuals and families gain money through things like jobs, investments, and inheritance and the pros and cons of various strategies for managing that money.
* Organizational finance looks at the norms of how companies raise capital at various stages and explores strategies for managing it
* Public finance examines how governments raise money through things like bonds and taxes and the various ways those funds can be managed and spent.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts play a critical role in the development of DeFi. A smart contract is a form of software that creates rules for governing digital transactions.
