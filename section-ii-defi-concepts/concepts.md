# Concepts

## What is finance, anyway?

We covered what "decentralized" means in the previous chapter \(you can look up many of these concepts in the [Glossary](https://app.gitbook.com/@kermankohli/s/defi-school/~/edit/drafts/-LrvNZgBZxv5SUzCrwPQ/section-vi-defi-glossary/teminology) of this Gitbook\), so what does "finance" actually cover?

Finance encompasses the theory and practice of raising and managing funds in a personal, organizational, or public context. 

* Personal finance explores how individuals and families gain money through things like jobs, investments, and inheritance and the pros and cons of various strategies for managing that money.
* Organizational finance looks at the norms of how companies raise capital at various stages and explores strategies for managing it
* Public finance examines how governments raise money through things like bonds and taxes and the various ways those funds can be managed and spent.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts play a critical role in the development of DeFi. A smart contract is a form of software that creates rules for governing digital transactions.
