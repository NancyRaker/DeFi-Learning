# Monolith

A non-custodial smart wallet providing users with a visa card to enable them to conveniently spend their crypto assets anywhere.

## Overview

### What is Monolith?

Monolith is an Ethereum-powered solution allowing you to spend your ETH and ERC-20 in real-life, the way you're used to: with a debit card accepted anywhere.

> You are the one and only in control of the assets stored in your contract wallet

Monolith cards are paired with a non-custodial contract wallet to secure crypto assets to the best of current technical possibilities. **You are the one and only in control of the assets stored in your contract wallet**.

üîí Each of our users deploys their own instance of the [Monolith contract wallet](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts).

Users can set up a whitelist as well as daily spending limits to protect their assets, even if their wallet was to be compromised, without compromising on the solution's usability.

### üí≥ How do I get a card?

The cards are already available and shipping to the UK, and most other European countries: **all 31 countries of the EEA.** All your interactions with the Monolith Wallet and Card are done using your phone.

üì± Our app is available on iPhone 6 and up from running iOS >=12, and Android >=7.0 (Nougat).

### üîê Where are my funds stored with Monolith?

> The [source code of the wallet](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts) is not only open-source (GPL3); it's also thoroughly documented to make sure each of our users can understand the functions they interact with daily.

Monolith provides you with a non-custodial Ethereum Contract Wallet. Don't panic; let's unpack this:

1. Your wallet is non-custodial: **you and only you** have access to the private key, required to sign off transactions. Yay! Freedom, autonomy and sovereignty. However, it also means that you have the responsibility of securing your private key.
2. It's a contract wallet - your funds are not stored in a "regular" (EOA) Ethereum account. Instead, you have the private key of an EAO that governs a smart contract, where your funds are stored. It allows for the implementation of another layer of security: a logic as to how your funds can move.

3. It's an Ethereum wallet - able to store ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and soon NFTs!

The [source code of the wallet](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts) is not only open-source (GPL3); it's also thoroughly documented to make sure each of our users can understand the functions they interact with daily.

Worried about smart contract failures? The code of our contract wallet has been [audited several times](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts/tree/master/audits) by companies including Trail of Bits & New Alchemy).
