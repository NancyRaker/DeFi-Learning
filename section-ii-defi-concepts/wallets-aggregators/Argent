# Argent

---

Argent is a new type of wallet built on smart contracts. It has the ease of use and security of the best new banking apps - yet it's non-custodial. You can earn interest with Compound in a tap, recover it without a seed phrase, and protect yourself from theft with daily withdrawl limits, large transfer approval and wallet locking.
