# Procedural

Procedural security considers the steps users can take to protect their assets.

Developers can make their applications as secure as possible but some security features depend on users taking certain precautions like using multi-factor authentication and hardware wallets.

When holding or using cryptocurrency, best practices include:

* Not disclosing holdings 
* Separating "savings" funds to be held in cold storage using paper or hardware wallets from "on-the-go" funds held in mobile, browser, or other, more accessible types of wallets. 
* Using multi-factor authentication
