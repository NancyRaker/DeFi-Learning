## The Principles of DeFi

As listed on the website, the core principles of DeFi include:

1. Interoperability and Open Source
2. Accessibility and Financial Inclusion
3. Financial Transparency

DeFi is about using decentralized infrastructure to develop financial products and services. These products and services often take the form of protocols or decentralized applications \(dApps\) that operate on Ethereum.

Ethereum is a public, permissionless implementation of distributed ledger technology that enables the creation of censorship-resistant applications. In other words, no single organization or individual providing infrastructure to operate the network has the power to stop an application from using it.
